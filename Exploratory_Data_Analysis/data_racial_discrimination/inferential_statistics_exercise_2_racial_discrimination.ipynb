    "# Examining Racial Discrimination in the US Job Market\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "Resumes with black-sounding names receive a callback rate of 6.4%, while white names receive a callback rate of 9.7%. This difference of 3.3 percentage points is statistically significant, as the p-value for the test of equality of callback rates is less than 0.001. Moreover, the 99% confience interval suggests that the true callback rate difference could range from 1.2 percentage points to 5.2 percentage points. Therefore, racial discrmination in the U.S. labor market still appears to be a continual challenge. \n",

A logistic regression is needed to examine which factors are significant predictors and their effect sizes. \n"
